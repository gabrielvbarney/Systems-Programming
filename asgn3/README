- Alright, so I am the student that was having major problems with building
  my tree and asked several questions during your office hours this past 
  Friday (10/25), as well as the one who spoke with you today in lab for, 
  shall I say, "advice", since I still had yet to fully finish htable. Since
  then, I have continued to work on my htable (while also doing some slight 
  implementation of a main for hdecode/hencode), but I still had no luck in 
  achieving perfection. With that being said, I am deciding now to halt my
  progression on the Lab/Asgn3, for the sake of balancing this class with other
  classes, as well as the inevitable lacking in quality of work since I would 
  be attempting to complete this assignment in 2 days (2 late days remaining),
  as well as to save the late days for the future.
  However, I modified my hencode/hdecode to pass the empty file test cases so 
  that my implementation would be some-what (some-what being very minimally)
  "correct." I am also halting my progress so that I may get started on the 
  Lab due this Friday, as well as studying for the midterm. It is quite 
  unfortunate that I am doing this, however, I realize that in the long-run 
  this program will not make or break my grade necessarily, and it is also 
  more important to progress in the class, rather than latching onto this 
  single project and falling behind. So with this being said, I am going to do
  everything in my power to prevent this from happening again, and I look 
  forward to continually redeeming myself so that this instance becomes more
  of a fluke than anything.
